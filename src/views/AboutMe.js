              Hi, I am <strong>Mateusz</strong>. I'm 28 years old. I have always
              been interested in computers. I like to play computer games my
              passion started with them. Whenever I had a problem with my
              computer I always tried to solve it. I looked for solutions on the
              Internet and proceeded step by step to solve it. I always pursued
              my goal. From an early age I learned the qualities important for a
              programmer, such as patience, searching for information on the
              Internet, solving problems, and striving for a goal.

              I like sports. The current favorite is snowboarding. I love
              snowboarding and the feeling of freedom, speed and adrenaline. I
              also enjoy kayaking and camping with my friends. I love to travel
              with my fianc√©. Exploring and hiking the trails. Watching wildlife
              in a natural environment. I enjoy playing computer and board
              games.

              In 2018, I decided to start programming. My first language to
              start with was c++. After finishing a course on youtube, I
              couldn't write anything myself, I didn't like it and stopped
              learning it. My next language was Python. Python was much
              friendlier than c ++. I became familiar with the beginner and
              advanced aspects of python however I didn't like it either. My
              third choice was HTML and CSS . I fell in love from the first line
              of code. Later I added JavaScript, which was very similar to
              Python, which made learning easier. Once I mastered HTML, CSS and
              JavaScript, I decided to add React.js. Since then, programming has
              become even more fun, and I write code with passion.
